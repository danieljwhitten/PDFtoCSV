# BEGIN INSTRUCTIONS
# This file contains a list of words that will be counted when PDFtoCSV.py
# is run in Report Only Mode, using the flag -ro. When the -ro flag is used 
# without any words listed after it, the words listed in this file are used 
# instead. Note that words added to this file will remain here unless removed
# or edited, so if you list words here for one project, ensure you remove them
# before your next project uses Report Only Mode again.
#
# Words should be listed here without spaces before or after, and with each
# new word on a new line. Multi-word/phrases are not compatible with this function
# at this time.
#
# Words preceded by a hash (#) are ignored. These instructions can therefore be left
# here without affecting the function of the program.
#
# END INSTRUCTIONS
