# BEGIN INSTRUCTIONS
# This file contains a list of words that will be counted when PDFtoCSV.py
# is run in Report Only Mode, using the flag -ro. When the -ro flag is used 
# without any words listed after it, the words listed in this file are used 
# instead. Note that words added to this file will remain here unless removed
# or edited, so if you list words here for one project, ensure you remove them
# before your next project uses Report Only Mode again.
#
# Words should be listed here without spaces before or after, and with each
# new word on a new line.
#
# Phrases can be included on one line. The program will only include instances of
# the whole phrase. The frequency report will still count individual words.
# For example, if the source text is "This is a test, this shows how phrases work."
# and "this is" is added to this file, the program will only include instances of 
# "this is" and give a count of "this: 1, is: 1".
#
# Words preceded by a hash (#) are ignored. These instructions can therefore be left
# here without affecting the function of the program.
