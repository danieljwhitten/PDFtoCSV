# BEGIN INSTRUCTIONS
# This file contains a list of words that will be counted when PDFtoCSV.py
# is run in Report Ignore Mode, using the flag -ri. When the -ri flag is used 
# without any words listed after it, the words listed in this file are used 
# instead. Note that words added to this file will remain here unless removed
# or edited, so if you list words here for one project, ensure you remove them
# before your next project uses Report Ignore Mode again.
#
# By default, this list is populated with common English stop words, as compiled
# here: http://xpo6.com/list-of-english-stop-words/
#
# If you wish to modify this list for a project, it is recommended to make a copy
# of the default file elsewhere, so that the stop word list can be replaced if needed.
#
# Words should be listed here without spaces before or after, and with each
# new word on a new line. Multi-word/phrases are not compatible with this function
# at this time.
#
# Words preceded by a hash (#) are ignored. These instructions can therefore be left
# here without affecting the function of the program.
