    "### Anaconda & Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "We recommend using this program via the [Anaconda Data Science Platform](https://www.anaconda.com/). This includes Jupyter Notebooks, and you likely already have it installed if you are viewing this file.  \n",
    "This program can also be run via any Python interpreter, including from the command line, if you have the technical knowledge to do so. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Python 3\n",
    "This program is written using the latest version of Python to date. To ensure you are ready to run it, ensure that the top right corner of your Jupyter Notebook says `Python 3`. If it does not, try to change it by going to the `Kernel` menu, choosing `Change Kernel`, then `Python 3`. If you do not see this option, you may need to download the latest version of Anaconda [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).  \n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. Install Tesseract\n",
    "Tesseract is the tool this program uses to read text from pages that do not have machine-readable text. It is is a free, open-source program (sponsored by Google) that performs Optical Character Recognition (OCR). It must be installed first for this program to work properly. More information about Tesseract OCR can be found [here](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/master/README.md).\n",
    "#### Windows\n",
    "1. Download the Tesseract OCR installer [here](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki).  \n",
    "2. Run the .exe file once it has been downloaded.  \n",
    "3. Accept all default options.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mac\n",
    "The easiest way is to install via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), a handy installer that works to easily install all kinds of usefuly programs, in addition to Tesseract OCR.  \n",
    "  * Open Terminal (Press Command + Space, type \"Terminal\", press Enter)  \n",
    "  * Paste: ```/usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"```  \n",
    "  * Press Enter  \n",
    "  * Press Enter again  \n",
    "  * Enter your computer password to authorize installation when prompted  \n",
    "  * Homebrew has successfully installed once you  see `==> Installation successful!`  \n",
    "  * Paste the following: `brew install tesseract`  \n",
    "  * Press Enter  \n",
    "\n",
    "For experienced users, see [here](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki#macos) for other installation options.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Linux\n",
    "If your distribution uses `apt`, like Ubuntu, the following should install Tesseract OCR:  \n",
    "`sudo apt install tesseract-ocr`  \n",

    "## How to Use the Program\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prepare Your PDF Input\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Legible Black and White Typed Text\n",
    "It works best with PDF files that have clearly legible typed black text on a white background. The majority of the text should be in the same font and the same size. The program will still try to process files with coloured backgrounds or various non-standard fonts, but the quality of the output may be low.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Clearly Labelled Files\n",
    "The output will be one single CSV file (can be opened as a spreadsheet in Microsoft Excel). The text from each page of each document will be included on a separate line. Each line will have:\n",
    "1. The path of the source file, including preceding folders and the name of the file\n",
    "  * Eg. \"path/to/folder/with/PDF/2019/January/1Jan2019.pdf\"\n",
    "2. The page number, relative to each file\n",
    "3. The number of words captured from the page\n",
    "4. The text of the page  \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this format, it is most convenient for you to take the time to name your folders and files descriptively. The program processes the files in the same order that they appear on your computer, when sorted by file name. However, if your folders are randomly or inconsistantly named, it will make it harder to sort and analyze the data\n",
    "                \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Awareness of Time Required\n",
    "This program extracts text in two different ways. First, it tries to see if any text is already embedded in the PDF (i.e., the PDF is \"machine readable\"). If there is no text embedded, the program then uses [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki) to read the letters on the page as plain text. It is not crucial to understand how this works, but it will make a different for how long the file(s) will take to process.\n",
    "* Machine readable PDF: ~0.009 seconds/page\n",
    "* Non-machine readable: ~1 second/100 words on page\n",
    "\n",
    "While this does not make a large difference if the file has only a few pages, the time difference increases with larger files, and can take days for 20,000+ pages. In order to accurately estimate the time required, open up your PDF files and determine whether they are machine readable or not. The easiest way is to search for a word you know is in the file. If your PDF reader finds the word, it has \"read\" the file, and the file is machine readable. If it does not, it is likely not machine readanble, and will require OCR. Another way of checking is to try to highligh the text with your mouse, if it highlights the lines of text, the page is likely machine readable. If it highlights the entire page as one large box, it is likely not.  \n",
    "For larger files, it is common to have some non-machine readable files distributed within machine readable pages. This is common with advertisements in newspapers, for example. The program will process any machine readble file accordingly, and only use OCR on individual pages when necessary, so such file should still be processed relatively quickly.  \n",
    "In order to optimize the speed of processing, minimize other tasks being performed by your computer at the same time. Computers have limited processing resources, so watching videos, surfing the internet, or writing in a word processor will all negatively impact the processing time for your files. This is not to say that one cannot multitask while processing files, and the effect is only noticable on large batches of non-machine readable files that are continually processing for hours or days at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Run the Program\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "In Jupyter Notebooks, you can either use the cell below (Under \"Ready to Go!\"), or navigate to the folder where you downloaded this program and create a new notebook.  \n",
    "In a new cell, paste: `%run PDFtoCSV.py \"path/to/folder/with/PDF\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### From Command Line\n",
    "If you do not want to run the program via Jupyter Notebooks, it is possible to run via the command line (Command Prompt or Terminal), by running the following command `python path/to/download/PDFtoCSV.py /path/to/folder/with/PDFs`, replacing the first path with the location of this program and the second with the location of your PDFs."

This can be read using **O**ptical **C**haracter **R**ecognition (OCR), which takes much longer to process. This mode ignores all OCR text and only processes machine-readable text.

It examines each element on each page and checks all images to see if they contain readable text. During default mode, there is a potential pitfall where OCR text can be overlooked if there is also machine-readable text on the page. For example, if a page has a typed header and footed, but the content is a scanned image, the default mode will process the machine-readable header and footer and ignore the scanned image, as it has determined that the page is machine-readable. Thorough mode will process all elements on the page. The tradeoff for this comprehenisive analysis is a much slower processing speed for files that contain mostly machine-readable text, as these would be processed very quickly in default mode.\n",

    "It is often helpful to have a long list of words to either include or ignore in frequency reports, using the `-ro` or `-ri` [flags](#Selective-Reporting-Options). \n",
    "To facilitate this, there are two text files in the [options](options) folder that can be filled with custom word lists. Using either the `-ro` or `-ri` flags without any words afterward will automatically refer to the words listed in the respective file. By default, [ReportOnly.txt](options/ReportOnly.txt) is empty, while [ReportIgnore.txt](options/ReportIgnore.txt) is populated by a large [list](http://xpo6.com/list-of-english-stop-words/) of common English stop words. Both can be modified and saved for re-use. Note that, once modified, **they will remain that way indefinitely unless changed**. Detailed instructions are available in the files themselves for formatting and use. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, custom lists of words saved as text files can be used as well. Simply paste the full path to the text file (surrounded by quotation marks) after the flag. Eg. `-ro \"path/to/wordlist.txt\"`."
