# BEGIN INSTRUCTIONS
# This file contains a list of words that will be removed when PDFtoCSV.py
# is run in Process Ignore Mode, using the flag -pi. When the -pi flag is used 
# without any words listed after it, the words listed in this file are used 
# instead. Note that words added to this file will remain here unless removed
# or edited, so if you list words here for one project, ensure you remove them
# before your next project uses Report Ignore Mode again.
# 
# NOTE: If no words are listed in this file and the -pi flag is used, the words
# from StopWords.txt will be used instead. Please see that file for further details.
#
# Phrases can be included on one line. The program will only ignore instances of
# the whole phrase. The frequency report will still count individual words.
# For example, if the source text is "This is a test, this shows how phrases work."
# and "this is" is added to this file, the program will only ignore instances of 
# "this is" and output the text as "a test, this shows how frames work."
#
# Words preceded by a hash (#) are ignored. These instructions can therefore be left
# here without affecting the function of the program.
